	Set MAX torque. This might not have an effect on 24v, but definitely does on 48v.
	Added Thor code.

	RC drives like PC. This means that any speed can be used, rather than the limit of around 4 MPH wheel speed for analog mode.

	Removed Zero Target and Position from RC initialization. This screws up the encoder calculations when released from e-stop into RC mode. Also it doesn't help anything (Sure it's convient to start your robot with 0 encoder ticks, but this doesn't guarantee that, and a properly written driver [such as our Player driver] does not assume the ticks start at 0)
